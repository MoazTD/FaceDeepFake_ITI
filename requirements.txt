Requirements for the Open-Source Deepfake Project
===================================================================
To install all these packages, run the following command in your terminal:
pip install -r requirements.txt
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1: For CPU-only systems
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Use this section if you do not have a dedicated NVIDIA GPU or do not
wish to set up CUDA.
Core GUI Framework
pyside6

AI and Machine Learning
onnxruntime         # For running ONNX models on the CPU
torch               # Core library for deep learning operations
torchvision         # Provides access to popular datasets, model architectures, and image transformations

Image and Data Processing
numpy               # Fundamental package for numerical computation
opencv-contrib-python # Computer vision library, including main modules + extra modules (like the face module)
scikit-image        # Collection of algorithms for image processing
scipy               # Library for scientific and technical computing

Model Downloading and Utilities
requests            # Robust library for making HTTP requests (more advanced than urlretrieve)
huggingface-hub     # For interacting with the Hugging Face Hub to download models
tqdm                # A fast, extensible progress bar for loops and CLI

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2: For NVIDIA GPU systems (CUDA) - OPTIONAL
-------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA installed, comment out the CPU
packages above (onnxruntime, torch, torchvision) and uncomment
the corresponding packages below for significantly faster performance.
NOTE: For PyTorch (torch, torchvision), it is HIGHLY recommended to
visit the official PyTorch website for the specific command that
matches your version of CUDA: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
The versions below are common examples, but may need to be adjusted.
